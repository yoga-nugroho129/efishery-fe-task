### UI Explanation

## `Simple Table`

I'm using simple UI table because the data that needs to be displayed is only the table, so I dont want to try to `reinvent the wheel` about the new aesthetic on displaying the table. I'm sure that this is the best way to display table.

## `Table Row Hover Effect`

It will make user much easier to recognize where is the row that they are currently reading for.
